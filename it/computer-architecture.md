# Computer Architecture

**Abstraction**: Take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.

We don't worry about things like binary in computing because of abstraction.

Bugs are abstracted out into error messages.



### The Four Main Layers of a Computer

- **Hardware**: made up of the physical components of a computer
- **Operating System**: allows hardware to communicate with the system
- **Software**: how we as humans interact with our computer
- **Users**: interacts with the computer - what makes up most of the IT job
