# Assembling a Desktop Computer

1. Prevent an electrostatic discharge. This can ruin a component. Two options to ground yourself:
   - Touch an electrial device that is plugged in, but not powered on, every few minutes.
   - Wear an anti-static wristband.
2. Insert a motherboard that fits your computer case. The screw holes on the motherboard coincide with the screw holes in the desktop case. Screw in the **standoffs** which are used to raise and attach your mothterboard to the case. Sometimes these are built into the case.
3. Add the CPU. There is a marker on the CPU that must align with the CPU socket on the motherboard. You will need to use a bit of force to secure it in.
4. Add the heat sink on top of CPU. First, you need to apply an even amount of thermal paste. It helps better connect the CPU and heat sink. Evenly coat the CPU with a flat object (e.g. credit card).
5. Plug the heat sink into the motherboard. This will control the fan speed.
6. Find the DIMM slots on the motherboard. Insert the RAM sticks into the slots. If you have both black and white slots, stick to the white slots.
7. Slide your hard drive into the cage.
8. Connect your hard drive to the motherboard with a SATA power plug.
9. Find a label on your motherboard that says Rear Fans (not all have this). Install the fan into the rear location and plug it in.
10. Install the power supply into the case. Screw it into the case.
11. The big connector on the power supply powers the motherboard. There are other connectors, one which is used for the CPU.
12. The case will have a few connectors. They are for things like case buttons and lights. Plug these into the motherboard. 
13. Fasten loose cables to any clips available on the case.
14. Install the graphics card into the PCIe port. You may need to apply some pressure.
15. Cover up the case. Connect your mouse, keyboard, and monitor.
