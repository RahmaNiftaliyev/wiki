# History of Computing

**What is a computer?** A computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.



### History

- An abacus (500 B.C.) is one of the earliest know computers. It was used to count large numbers.

- A mechanical calculator (17th century) was invented by Blaise Pascal. It was able to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
- In the 1800s, Joseph Jacquard invented a programmable loom. Looms took cards with a sequence of holes (punch cards), that made up the design pattern of the fabric. Hooks went only in the holes.
- Later, Charles Babbage created a difference engine, a sophisticated version of the mechanical calculator. He followed up with an Analytical Engine, which used punch cards to predefine calculations, instead of manually entering them in by hand.
- Next, Ada Lovelace became the first person to recognize that the Analytical Engine could be used for more than pure calculators. She created the first algorithm for the engine--our first example of computer programming. This turned the Analytical Engine into the first general purpose computing machine in history.
  - **What is an algorithm?** A series of steps that solves specific problems.
- WWII caused the government to pour resources into computing research. Lots of advancement in **cryptography** (the art of writing and solving codes). Alan Turing was key in helping crack codes.
- Post-WWII, lots of advancements were made by organizations like IBM and HP. Until the 50s, punch cards were still used to store data. Inventions like magnetic tape, which magnetizing data onto a tape, changed how data was stored.
- The ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of a general purpose coomputer. It took up 1800 square feet of floor space and has 17,000 vacuum tubes (which control the electricity voltages)
- Eventually, we started using transistors instead of vacuum tubes (much more compact).
- Grace Hopper invented the first compiler, a massive milestone.
  - **What is a compiler?** A program that translates human language (e.g. a programming language) to machine code.
- The Xerox Alto was the first computer that resembles the computers of today. It had a GUI that used icons, a mouse, and a window. Xerox started building affordable computers that started the consumer age of computing.
- In the 1970s, Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I, a computer for hobbyists. He and Steve Jobs created Apple Computer.
  - The follow-up, the Apple II, was a great success, and sold for two decades. The middle class could now own computers.
- In the 1980s, IBM introduced the PC, released with MS DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System). IBM partned with Microsoft which eventually created Windows, the preferred operating system in the workplace.
- In the 1970s and 80s, arcades started to become popular. Atari developed one of the first coin-operated arcade games in 1972 called Pong, which launched the video game era. Atari then brought videos games into the home with the launch of the Video Computer System. Video games pushed computing forward, as computers could now be used for recreation as well.
- Unix was an OS developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but it was expensive. Richard Stallman developed a free Unix-like OS called GNU, which was open sourced (anyone could modify or share it).
  - GNU set a founcation for the formation of the largest open source OS, Linux, created by Linus Torvalds.
- In the 90s, PDAs (personal digital assistants) were introduced, which allowed computing to go mobile. In the late 90s, Nokia introduced a PDA with mobile phone functionality (a.k.a a smartphone).
