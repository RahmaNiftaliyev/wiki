# Installing an Operating System

### Choosing an Operating System

The operating systems in use by an organization have a lot to do with the applications and systems that they need to run.

Ask yourself what software needs to be run on the device. If the software is cross-platform, ask yourself what hardware will be used. Some manufacturers allow their operating system to only be installed on their hardware.

Note that our operating system will be optimized for the CPU architecture that you use (32-bit vs 64-bit).

- A 64-bit CPU requires a 64-bit operating system

Using a USB drive with an installation image is an easy way to install an operating system.



### Windows vs macOS vs Linux

**Windows**

- **Pros:** Lots of software. Best option for gaming.
- **Cons:** Lots of security issues. Must keep up to date.



**macOS**

- **Pros:** Free upgrades. Best option for creatives (apps like Adobe and Premier function better and have more options). Less frequently targetd by malware.
- **Cons:** Hardware is expensive. Less free software.



**Linux**

- **Pros:** Highly customizable. Free. Great for resurrecting old hardware that is too slow to run Windows.
- **Cons:** Less user friendly. Learning curve is steep. 



**Other options:**

- **Chrome OS:** Only lets you use Chrome, Chrome apps, and Android apps
- **BSD**: Berkley Software Distribution--a Unix-based system developed for researchers. Great for users that prioritize functions like complex networking or a high level of security. Not a lot of support for third-party developers.
- **Dual-Booting**: e.g. you can boot Linux for productivity tasks and boot Windows for gaming (note: this is risky)
- **Virtual Machine**: Running an OS virtually inside your main OS
