# Mobile Device Repair

Repairing a device on your own will usually void the warranty. With specific training, you may be perform some repairs without voiding the warranty (e.g. repairing a screen).

Usually the device will need to be sent for repair with the manufacturer. Understand the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) policy for each device you deal with.

A **factory reset** removes all data, apps, and customizations from the device. You should do this before a device is serviced.
