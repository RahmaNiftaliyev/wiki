# BIOS

**Services/Drivers**

Our devices use programs called **services** or **drivers** to tell the CPU how to run them.



**BIOS (Basic Input Output Services)** 

The CPU connects to the **BIOS**, which is software that helps initialize the hardware in our computer and gets our OS up and running.

The BIOS is stored on the motherboard in a **ROM (read only memory) chip**. If the computer is turned off, the data will not get erased.

**UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** is a more modern BIOS contender. Most hardware comes with UEFI built in. It will soon be the predominant BIOS.



**Power On Self Test (POST)**

The beep you may hear after turning a computer on is a test to see all hardware is working properly. BIOS runs it when you boot up your computer.

The POST figures out the hardware is on the computer, so it happens before BIOS initalizes any hardware or loads up the essential drivers. Different beeps equate to different problems. It communicates issues before a video driver is even loaded.

Refer to your motherboard to see what the beeps mean.



**CMOS Battery**

A special battery on the motherboard. It stores basic data about booting your computer (date, time, how to start up). You can change these settings by booting into the CMOS/BIOS menu. This menu can let you boot from an external device, so you can proceed with a reimaging task.
