# DevTools

- In your CSS file, comment out CSS declarations you're unsure of. They will appear in DevTools as crossed out and you can enable them if you want.
- DevTools only shows you base styles (and not hover styles, for example). Press `.hov` to force an element state.
- The browser will convert color codes from one type to another. Hold shift while clicking on a color to change the type. You can also click on the color for a color wheel.
- Aim for contrast ratios of 4.5
- Firefox DevTools will give you additional information over why a declaration does not work (e.g. "width has no effect on this element since it has a display of inline. Try adding display:inline-block or display:block")
