# CSS

## px vs rem vs em

- An `em` is equal to the computed font size of the element's parent. So, `1 em` of an `H1` is equal to the size of the letter "m" in an `H1`.

- Use `rem` everywhere, including margins and padding, except for borders. Use px for those--they are only decroative. 
- Root font-size for most browsers is 16px.
