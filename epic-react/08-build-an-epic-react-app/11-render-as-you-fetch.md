# Render as you Fetch

Render as you fetch is all about kicking off requests for the needed code, data, or assets as soon as you have the information you need to retrieve them. You go about this by applying this process:

1. Take a look at everything you're loading
2. Determine the minimal amount of things you need to start rendering something useful to the user
3. Start loading those things as soon as you possibly can



## Exercise

In this exercise, we're going to see how we can squeeze our network waterfall over the left as much as we can for the things the user needs. We're a little limited because this is a client-side application only. You can take this further with server side rendered applications. So if your app requires *screaming* fast performance, then consider investigating a server-side rendering framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or a static site generation framework like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

Here's what happens when a logged-in user goes to our app:

1. Get the document (`index.html`)
2. Get the linked JS (`<script src="...">`) and CSS (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`)
3. Parse the JS
4. Execute the JS

By code-splitting, we're reducing the amount of work the browser has to do in step 3 and 4. But there's more we can do during that execute JS step. Let's break down what happens in our app as the browser executes the JavaScript:

1. Call into all the modules (in import order)
2. Create a bunch of React components
3. Render those components with `ReactDOM.render`. At this point, React calls into all of our components to get the react elements
4. Our components are "mounted" by React and our `useEffect` callbacks are called
5. We make a fetch to get the logged in user's information and the AuthProvider displays a spinner while we wait.
6. The user's information comes back successfully, so now we render the Authenticated app (luckily we've pre-fetched that thanks to the webpack magic comment)
7. We make a fetch to get the user's list items. We show an empty list while we wait.
8. The list items come back and we render those list items.

So what's the optimization we can make here? Well, everywhere you see "while we wait" could be optimized further. In particular, we could start fetching the user's information as well as their list items as soon as our JavaScript executes rather than waiting for the app to render all our components.

For this first exercise, let's just start by triggering the fetch for the user earlier in the chain of events. Specifically, we'll start the user fetch request to something that happens during step 1.



```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import {jsx} from '@emotion/core'

import * as React from 'react'
import * as auth from 'auth-provider'
import {client} from 'utils/api-client'
import {useAsync} from 'utils/hooks'
import {FullPageSpinner, FullPageErrorFallback} from 'components/lib'

async function getUser() {
  let user = null

  const token = await auth.getToken()
  if (token) {
    const data = await client('me', {token})
    user = data.user
  }

  return user
}

const AuthContext = React.createContext()
AuthContext.displayName = 'AuthContext'

// This gets moved out of the AuthProvider useEffect
// ðŸ¦‰ this means that as soon as this module is imported,
// it will start requesting the user's data so we don't
// have to wait until the app mounts before we kick off
// the request.
const userPromise = getUser()

function AuthProvider(props) {
  const {
    data: user,
    error,
    isLoading,
    isIdle,
    isError,
    isSuccess,
    run,
    setData,
    status,
  } = useAsync()

  React.useEffect(() => {
    run(userPromise)
  }, [run])

  const login = React.useCallback(
    form => auth.login(form).then(user => setData(user)),
    [setData],
  )
  const register = React.useCallback(
    form => auth.register(form).then(user => setData(user)),
    [setData],
  )
  const logout = React.useCallback(() => {
    auth.logout()
    setData(null)
  }, [setData])

  const value = React.useMemo(() => ({user, login, logout, register}), [
    login,
    logout,
    register,
    user,
  ])

  if (isLoading || isIdle) {
    return <FullPageSpinner />
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <FullPageErrorFallback error={error} />
  }

  if (isSuccess) {
    return <AuthContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
  }

  throw new Error(`Unhandled status: ${status}`)
}

function useAuth() {
  const context = React.useContext(AuthContext)
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error(`useAuth must be used within a AuthProvider`)
  }
  return context
}

function useClient() {
  const {
    user: {token},
  } = useAuth()
  return React.useCallback(
    (endpoint, config) => client(endpoint, {...config, token}),
    [token],
  )
}

export {AuthProvider, useAuth, useClient}

```



## Extra Credit

### 1. ðŸ’¯ Preload all initial data

[Production deploy](https://exercises-10-render-as-you-fetch.bookshelf.lol/extra-1)

For this extra credit, we want to move the list items fetch request to something that happens during step 1 as well. Luckily for us, our backend engineers are on board with that, so they created a special endpoint that will give you all the data you need in one request (otherwise we'd have to make multiple requests which is fine, just not as cool).

If you make a GET to the endpoint `bootstrap`, it will send you an object with the `user` and the user's `listItems`. You can use the `user` just like we're doing right now with the `me` endpoint (stick it in our AuthProvider), and then you can put the `listItems` in the `queryCache` so the user has their list items all ready to go as soon as the app finishes loading.

This will make a noticeable impact on the loading experience. You'll notice this improvement if you have a user with list items, then open their `/list` page. Before this change, you'll see a blank list and the list items will then appear a moment later. With this change, the list items are there instantly.
