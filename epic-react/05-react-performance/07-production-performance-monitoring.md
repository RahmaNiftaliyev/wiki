# Production Performance Monitoring

Adding production performance monitoring gives you a way to monitor any performance regressions that happen over time.

You need to build your app using `react-dom/profiling` and `scheduler/tracing-profiler` because there is a slight ding to performance. Facebook builds two apps, one with each method, and serves performance-monitoring version to some users.

The `<React.Profiler />` component won't give you everything DevTools will give you, but it gives you a lot.

Basic Usage:

```jsx
function onRenderCallback(
  id, // the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed
  phase, // either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)
  actualDuration, // time spent rendering the committed update
  baseDuration, // estimated time to render the entire subtree without memoization
  startTime, // when React began rendering this update
  commitTime, // when React committed this update
  interactions, // the Set of interactions belonging to this update
) {
  // Aggregate or log render timings...
}
```



```jsx
<App>
  <Profiler id="Navigation" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
    <Navigation {...props} />
  </Profiler>
  <Main {...props} />
</App>
```



## Exercises

### Add Performance Monitoring to an App

```jsx
// /src/report-profile.js
// This module is just here for the exercise and doesn't actually do anything.
// In reality, what I would recommend for a function like this is that it keeps
// a queue of all updates and every 10 seconds it sends profile data to your
// server if there's any data in the queue.
// Then you presumably graph that data in Grafana or similar
let queue = []

// we're doing every 5 seconds so we don't have to wait forever...
// actual time may vary based on your app's needs
setInterval(sendProfileQueue, 5000)

function reportProfile(
  id, // the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed
  phase, // either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)
  actualDuration, // time spent rendering the committed update
  baseDuration, // estimated time to render the entire subtree without memoization
  startTime, // when React began rendering this update
  commitTime, // when React committed this update
  interactions, // the Set of interactions belonging to this update
) {
  queue.push({
    id,
    phase,
    actualDuration,
    baseDuration,
    startTime,
    commitTime,
    interactions,
  })
  // this is a fire and forget, so we don't return anything.
}

function sendProfileQueue() {
  if (!queue.length) {
    return Promise.resolve()
  }
  const queueToSend = [...queue]
  queue = []
  console.info('sending profile queue', queueToSend)
  // here's where we'd actually make the server call to send the queueToSend
  // data to our backend... But we don't have a backend for this workshop so...
  return Promise.resolve()
}

export default reportProfile

```

```jsx
// exercise.js
// Production performance monitoring
// http://localhost:3000/isolated/exercise/07.js

import * as React from 'react'
import reportProfile from '../report-profile'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <React.Profiler id="counter" onRender={reportProfile}>
        <div>
          Profiled counter
          <Counter />
        </div>
      </React.Profiler>
      <div>
        Unprofiled counter
        <Counter />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App

```

You'll get updates like this:

```jsx
[
	{
  	actualDuration: 0.11499982792884111 // time spent rendering the commit
    baseDuration: 0.3899999428540468 // est. time rendering entire subtree w/o memoization
    commitTime: 22568.659999989904 // when React committed the update
    id: "counter"
    interactions: Set(0) {}
    phase: "update"
    startTime: 22568.285000044852 // when React began rendering the update
	}
]
```



### Experimental Trace API

The `interactions` argument that our `onRenderCallback` accepts are for tracing specific interactions. Interactions like button clicks or HTTP responses, etc. Using this helps us answer more specific questions about whatâ€™s causing things to be slow.

Information about this experimental API can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/8de925562903afd2e7a12554adcdda16).

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {unstable_trace as trace} from 'scheduler/tracing'
import reportProfile from '../report-profile'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  // trace(name, when the interaction started, callback for the thing we want to happen )
  const increment = () =>
    trace('click', performance.now(), () => setCount(c => c + 1))
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <React.Profiler id="counter" onRender={reportProfile}>
        <div>
          Profiled counter
          <Counter />
        </div>
      </React.Profiler>
      <div>
        Unprofiled counter
        <Counter />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App

```

```jsx
actualDuration: 0.8549999911338091
baseDuration: 0.5649999948218465
commitTime: 11236.275000032037
id: "counter"
interactions: [
	[
    {
      id: 0
			name: "click"
			timestamp: 11233.46500005573
    }
	]
]
phase: "update"
startTime: 11234.805000014603
```
