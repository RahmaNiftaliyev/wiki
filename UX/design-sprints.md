  - Sprints at their core are about inclusivity
- Gives design team undistracted time to focus
- Lowers risks of unsuccessful market debut due to feedback from users
- Versatile scheduling - can be scheduled at any point in your project



### When to Sprint

- Are there many potential solutions to a challenge?
- Do cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
- Is the challenge scope wide enough for a sprint?



### Five Phases of the Design Sprint

Usually one phase a day.

1. **Understand**
   - Sets your sprint on the right track. Helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.
   - Discuss with other people and departments.
2. **Ideate**
   - Come up with ideas and build off of them to create solutions
   - Start sketching and presenting ideas
   - Plan for user testing - start recruiting for your target profile
3. **Decide**
   - Discuss each possible solution. Decide on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.
   - Create a step-by-step blueprint for your prototype.
4. **Prototype**
   - Build the first version of your new app feature - just something realistic enough to test with users
   - Confirm the test schedule and finalize interview questions
5. **Test**
   - Observe how users react and interview them about their experiences
   - Gain critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch your product



### Steps to Planning a Design Sprint

1. User Research
   - Done by UX researcher, or yourself
   - Focus on the user problems you're trying to solve during this sprint
2. Call the Experts
   - Schedule talks with colleagues or industry experts to discuss the problem you're trying to solve
3. Find the Right Space
   - Get a space with a whiteboard, room for sticky notes, good acoustics, necessary accommodations, comfortable furniture
4. Gather Supplies
   - Markers, sticky notes, snacks, water
5. Estable the Rules for the Sprint
   - Sets the tone for the sprint. Set rules like no distractions.
6. Planning Introductions
   - Sprints often involve cross functional teams with people that have never met before
   - Icebreakers can motivate your team and set the right mindset
   - Good icebreaker: Talk about a time you called customer service to complain (this puts people into the shoes of a user)
7. Post-Sprint Planning
   - How will your team use what you have learned to achieve other goals?
   - Have people document every step of the design sprint (notes and photos)



### The Design Spring Brief

**Sprint Brief**: A document that you share with all of your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint

- List **sprint challenge** which introduces the team to the sprint objectives
- Identify **key deliverables** - what does your team actually want to create?
- List **logistics** - where, when, who is attending, name of sprint master
- Add **approvers** - who needs to sign off before launch?
- List **resources**
  - A short term sprint probably has a team already assigned to this project
  - Long term sprints may need a plan to secure additional resources
- List **project overview**
  - Explain the current state of the project
  - Call out roadblocks
  - State early wins
  - Outline estimated launch plan
- Set **sprint schedule** - an hour by hour schedule with break times

### Design Sprint Retrospective

**Retrospective**: A collaborative critique of the team's design sprint.

Helps you stop making mistakes for good.

Do it immedietly following the sprint so everyone's thoughts are fresh.

There's never an agenda. The goal is to get feedback from every participant.

**Key Questions**:

- What went well?
  - What tools saved you the most time and effort?
  - When did you feel the most satisfaction?
  - What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
  - Acknowledge a team member's strong performance. Celebrate success.
- What can be improved?
  - Reduce groupthink by collecting thoughts before discussing them
  - What went wrong that caught you off guard?
  - Which problems came up the most often?
  - When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?
  - Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design? 
  - Did an external factor derail your productivity? 
  - And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?
