# Design Across Platforms

**Platform:** The medium that users experience your product on (e.g. desktop, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays, etc..)

You need to design with multiple platforms in mind because users want a product to look and feel similar, no matter what platform they're using. One user may use your product on multiple platforms.



Focus on one platform first when you first build a product. Select the platform that best meets your end users' needs.



Some functionalities only exist on certains platforms, e.g. a voice assistant.



**Brand Identity**: The visual appearance and voice of a company.

Not only is it important to have consistent user experience across platforms, it's also important to have a consistent brand identity.



### User Behavior Across Platforms

Users behave differently, depending on their device. Some may also use screen readers, closed captioning, or switch devices.

- The average mobile session is 72 seconds
  - Users tend to be goal-oriented. They are focused on completing a single task.
  - We need to design for all types of phones--whether they cost $50 or $500
- The average desktop session is 150 seconds



**Responsive Web Design:** Allows a website to chance automatically depending on the size of the device.

- Best practices for desining mobile web experiences:
  1. Call-to-action buttons should be placed front and center, allowing users to easily complete the desired task.
  2. Navigation menus should be short and simple. Menu options should only highlight the core functions of the product.
  3. Use gestures that users already do. Gestures should be intuitive and familiar to users.
  4. Design for both directions--portrait and landscape.
  5. Reduce visual clutter. Keep the visual experience simple on a small screen.



### The Four C's of Designing for Multiple Platforms

- **Consistency**: Stay consistent with brand identity. Stay true to brand guidelines in order to maintain consistency across platforms and to drive brand awareness. It helps improve user experience and build trust.
- **Continuity**: Users should maintain progress as they move from one platform to the next. The UX for each platform may be slightly different, but the product's functionality should still be connected. e.g. For an email client, an email should be able to be started on a desktop and, saved to drafts, and finished on mobile.
- **Context**: Think about when and how users prefer to interact with certain features on different platforms. A watch app should show notifications, but you probably don't need to be able to type a whole email on it. Adapt the design for each platform accordingly. 
- **Complementary** Make sure each design of each platform adds something new for the user. e.g. Make it easy to upload photos via a phone. Take into account how each platform could enrich the overall user experience.



### Assistive Technology (AT)

**Assistive Technology (AT)**: Any products, equipment, and systems that ehance learning, workig, and daily living for people with disabilities.

- ATs make everyone life easier, not just those with disabilities 
- Covers a wide range of devices: computers, tablets, smartphones, prosthetics, pointing devices, electric wheelchairs, power lifts, eye gaze and head trackers, pencil grips, etc..
- It's critical to understand how people with disabilites use your products as part of the UX design process
  - **Color modification** (e.g. high contract mode) includes increasing the contrast of colors on the screen--which makes screens easier to see for people with low vision. Color modification can help people who experience eye strain when viewing screens in the day, or when there is a glare.
  - **Voice control** and switch devices help people with limited dexterity. 
    - **Switch: ** An assistive technology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse
  - **Screen readers** are one of the most popular technologies for people with limited vision.
    - Alternative (alt) text describes meaningful images for someone that can't see the image. It's also helpful for those with low bandwidth or if an image fails to load.
  - **Speech to Text** helps many people type -- it offers many people and hands free and experience and reduces the mental energy needed to type
