### **What is User Experience?**

User experience design is a user-centered approach to solving design problems. UX designers merge usability and craft to solve problems for all aspects of a product, service, community, or an individual person's needs. It is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.

**What is a product?** It is a good, service, or feature.



### What makes a good user experience?

A product that is:

		- **Usable**: Make something easier to use. The design, structure, and purpose of a product should be clear to everyone. **Every** user must be able to use your product, including non-native speakers, users with disabilities, or people with very different life experiences than yours.
		- **Equitable:** Your designs are are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
		- **Enjoyable:** Creates a positive connection between the user and the product. Take the user's thoughts and feelings into account. User research helps you collect evidence about how a user experiences a product.
		- **Useful:** The product solves our problems. 



Notice the things in your every day life. What works well? What can be improved on?



### Why is UX important to a business?

2018, McKinsey & Company studied companies in three industries: medical, consumer goods, and retail banking. They found that any business that focuses on good usabilty and design performed better than their competitors.

When people like a product, they use that product a lot. They also recommend it to others. They are also more likely to have a positive experience of the company that made it.
