# UX Design Tools

### Wireframing and Prototyping Tools

**Figma**: All-in-one wireframing and prototyping tool that allows for real-time collaboration among multiple team members.

**Adobe XD**: Great for editing graphics, building prototypes, and collaborating with other people on your team. Has robust features for tasks that happen during high-fidelity designs.

**Sktech**: Another popular wireframing and prototyping tool. Only available on macOS.

**Framer X**: A tool that lets you develop prototypes and animations. You'll need some familiarity with coding.



### Presentation Tools

**Google Slides:** Web-based presentation program included in Google Workspace.

**Microsoft PowerPoint:** One of the first presentation programs created. Part of Microsoft's 365 program package. Comes in both online and offline versions. Anyone can view a presentation, however you must own the product to create or edit a presentation.

**Keynote:** Apple's presentation program. Has visually appealing templates. Available both online and offline. It can be used on PC as well. You must own the product to make edits or create new presentations.



### Image Creation and Manipulation Tools

**Adobe Illustrator:** Primarily used for **vector images (SVGs)**: images that use points (vectors) to produce perfectly smooth lines. You can use Illustrator to draw protoypes and illustrations for your designs.

**Adobe Photoshop:** Works with photos (raster images). These images are composed of thousands or millions of pixels, the smallest unit of display on a computer screen. Illustrator is a better tool for creating images from scratch,  however Photoshop has more uses, such as image manipulation across file types, saving images for digital publishing, and even presentations.



### Animation Tools

**Lottie:** A tool that helps you edit and ship animations in just a few clicks. Animation files formatted in Lottie, known as LottieFiles, use less disk space since they are code-based. You can also use Lottie to explore animations created by other designers for inspiration.

**Adobe After Effects**: Often used to add motion graphics and visuall effects to designs. You can use After Effects to make text move across a screen or to create transitions between pages.
