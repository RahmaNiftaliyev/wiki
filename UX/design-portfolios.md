# UX Design Portfolios

**Portfolio**: A collection of work you've created that shows your skills in a certain area. It is how you demonstrate your skilling during the job application process.

Most portfolios are on a website, which is easy to update and share. The design of the website itself is important as well.

You want your portfolio to tell a story and grab a user's attention. This will help you stand out.



### Examples of UX Designer Portfolios

- [Lisa's portfolio](http://www.lisasuefischer.com/) is a great example of visually-pleasing design that lets her personal brand shine. Lisa has her own personal logo that can always be found at the top left corner of her website. Notice the consistency in color, design, and fonts across her site, too, which builds her personal brand and showcases her unique personality and work style. 
- [Dane's portfolio](https://danegalbraith.com/) is another example to take notes on. His case studies are sectioned into small chunks with headers that are easy to skim. You won't add case studies to your portfolio until Courses 5, 6, and 7 of this certificate program, but it's helpful to envision the information you'll include from throughout the design process. 
- [Shabi's portfolio](https://www.shabnamkashani.com/) is clean and straightforward. Her site features a minimal white background that allows the visual elements of her case studies to grab your attention. This is a common trend among modern UX design portfolios, since recruiters and hiring managers are mainly interested in quickly glancing at your work. Shabi uses her brand color, a seafoam green, strategically in her logo and design elements like buttons. She also uses one typeface throughout the site to keep the design clean and consistent. 
- [Nicolas' portfolio](https://www.nicolaspellegrino.com/) shows how you can use motion and animations to bring your portfolio to life. When you open Nicolas’ portfolio, you’re immediately greeted by text reading “Nice to see you.” As you scroll to the bottom of the homepage, each case study reveals itself. Using clean, non-distracting motion design elements in your portfolio is a great way to grab the visitor’s attention and make them eager to learn more about your projects.
- [Josh’s portfolio](https://joshglucas.com/) demonstrates how small details can make a huge impact. When you hover the cursor over each one of the projects on his homepage, a short overview describing the project appears. This is helpful for visitors who want to quickly find a particular type of project without having to click through each project individually. Recruiters frequently visit portfolio sites to learn about specific types of work and will give up if it takes too long to identify the right one, so categorizing your projects is key!

**Questions to Ask**

1. **How does the portfolio establish the designer’s personal brand?** (What type of first impression do each of these three designers make?) As a designer, your personal brand is how your personality, unique skills, and values intersect with your public persona. Your brand is the first impression you make! A personal brand should clearly demonstrate who you are as a designer and what makes you interesting. 
2. **Is the navigation simple and intuitive?** The navigation is the way users get from page to page on a website. Users should be able to reach the homepage from any part of your site. And your navigation should lead them from one project to the next. It should also be easy for users to navigate to a contact page that includes an email address, a copy of a resume, and links to other professional social media accounts.
3. **Does the portfolio website go beyond the template?** Although a website builder’s pre-designed layouts make it easy to get started, you need to go a step further. Portfolio designers can customize their websites to align with their brand and the story they want to tell. For example, designers should remove the text that comes pre-loaded in the template, and replace it with their own content. It's also helpful to register their own domain name, so their website’s address doesn’t contain the name of the website builder.
4. **Does the portfolio website include a diversity of projects?** Each portfolio should have 3-6 projects that demonstrate the designer’s skills. Note whether each portfolio contains a diversity of projects.
5. **Is the site housing the portfolio responsive?** Responsive means the on-screen appearance of the website adjusts based on the user’s device. So whether someone engages with the website on a desktop computer or mobile phone, they will have a positive experience.

   - A case study answers these questions:
     - What was the problem you were trying to solve?
     - What process did you follow?
     - Where did you succeed or fail?
     - What insights informed your design decisions along the way?
     - What was the ultimate solution, and why do you feel that solution was the best?
