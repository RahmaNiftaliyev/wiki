# Designing for the Next Billion Users (NBU)

**Next Billion Users (NBU):** The people around the world just starting to use the internet.



**Issues Facing NBUs**

1. **Cost** 
   - People with limited resources tend to buy less expensive devices with low RAM and low storage
2. **Connectivity**
   - People run out of data if their network coverage is spotty
   - The offline experience should be as rich as the online experience
3. **Digital Literacy:**
   - People might not be familiar with certain design patterns like CTAs, icons, and gestures. This can affect their confidence and willingness to explore technology.
   - Keep things simple. Consider video tutorials for all features.
4. **Literacy in General**
   - Consider multilingual keyboard options and universally understood icons



YouTube Go is an example of an app specifically designed for emerging market users.

- Allows a preview of frames to get a better sense of what the video is about
- Added nearby sharing option. Wirelessly transfer videos to other people's devices.
- Being offline isn't an error state. Lots of encouragement via design to download videos.
- More relevant videos, based on user preferences (language, location)

**Nine essential points to consider when designing**

1. **Internet access isn't guaranteed**
2. **Smaller, simpler devices are the norm**
   - Most emerging-market devices cost just $40-$60 and might come with 512MB of memory, a small low-res screen, and limited battery life
3. **Data is limited**
   - In 95% of emerging markets, people rely almost entirely on prepaid mobile data. Many can only afford 250MB a month. People power off their phones at night. They use peer-to-peer sharing.
   - Be transparent about your data consumption.
4. **Forget about credit cards**
   - 38% of the world's population doesn't use a bank. Less than 2% of Indians have credit cards.
   - COD (cash-on-delivery) is popular in many emerging markets. There's also apps like M-PESA (Kenya) that allows money transfer via PIN-secured text messages.
5. **Bridge the cultural divide**
   - Many people are uncomfortable with technology, especially when it comes to sharing data. Be explicit about how you're going to protect sensitive data.
   - The app Hike lets users hide certain chats behind a password--useful when people need to share devices.
6. **Get beyond language**
   - Many people rely on symbolic and visual literacy to navigate through apps
   - The app Viber provided large amount of sticker sets that allow users to express themselves
7. **Leverage human relationships**
   - If you can connect with people, you can get news, buy and sell things, search for information, express your identity, engage in conversation. Leverage person-to-persons trust when marketing your product.
8. **Leave minimalism at the door**
   - Minimal interfaces are currently only popular in the west. Be feature-dense and put navigation front and center.
9. **Design for delight**
   - The daily experience can be challenging. People appreciate design that attempts to charm and surprise. Even utility apps don't have to be boring.
