# Talk Like a UX Designer

**User:** Any person who uses a product

**End User:** The specific audience a UX designer creates something for. For a cartoon, the end user is a child. Adults will be in the audience as well, who are other users. Keep the end user as your priority. Though ads may market a toy to parents, the end user is the child. Design the toy to appeal to the child.

**User Experience:** How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product

**Iteration:** Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks
