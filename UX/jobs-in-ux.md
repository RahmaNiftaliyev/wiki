# Jobs in User Experience



**Job Responsibilities of an Entry-Level UX Designer**

- **Research**: Understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and life goals
- **Wireframing**: Create an outline or sketch of a product or a screen. One of the first steps after or during research. Designed to demonstrate the basic structure of the page to gain support from key stakeholders.
- **Prototyping**: Create an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality. Illustrates a progression from one screen to the next.
- **Creating information architecture**: Create the framework of a website or how it's organized, categorized, and structured. e.g. Going to a company's homepage should give you a link to an About page
- **Communicating effectively**: Meeting with colleagues, writing emails, creating proposals, or pitching clients.



**Specialists, Generalists, and T-Shaped Designers**

- **Generalist:** A UX designer with a broad number of responsibilities. How most UX designers start. Common at smaller companies. You get to try out different things and find a speciality you're passionate about.
  - May be responsible for:
    - User Research
      - User research is about understanding the people who use your product. Through research, you’ll learn about users’ backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and goals. Your research methods might include surveys, observations, and interviews. We’ll explore user research in much more detail in an upcoming course. 
    - Branding
    - User Flows
    - UX Writing
    - Visual Design
      - Visual design focuses on how the product or technology looks. As a UX designer, you need to understand the foundations of visual design in order to communicate the connection between a product’s functionality and its appearance to users. You’ll learn some of the most important principles of visual design throughout this certificate program. 
    - Wireframing
      - A wireframe is a basic outline or sketch of a product or a screen, like an app or website. As the name suggests, wireframes look like they were created with wires. They’re mostly lines and shapes, with some text. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally using software. Wireframing helps you bring your design ideas to life, so other people on your team can provide input and feedback. 
    - Prototyping
      - A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. Prototypes can be in physical or digital formats and can vary in complexity. Sometimes a prototype is made to demonstrate one specific feature of a product, like the transition between screens or the way the product physically looks and feels. You’ll make multiple prototypes for any given product throughout the design process.
    - Production Design
    - Information Architecture
      - Information architecture, or IA for short, involves deciding how your product is organized and structured. Think of IA as a skeleton that outlines how users interact with your product. Everything in your product should be organized in ways that make sense to the user and meets their expectations.
    - Usability Testing
    - Effective Communication
      - Effective communication as a UX designer means connecting with your colleagues through emails, meetings, presentations, and design software. UX design is a very collaborative field, so being able to communicate both digitally and face-to-face with teammates is important. You need to be a good listener, be receptive to feedback, and share your ideas in a clear way.
- **Specialist:** Dives deep into one particular UX design role, like interaction, visual, or motion design. Usually at large companies.
- **T-Shaped Designer:** Specializes in one kind of UX design and has a breadth of capabilities in other areas



**Cross-Functional Teams**

- UX designers work with other designers, engineers, researchers, product leads, or program managers

- Example - Building an app where you can order food:
  - **Product Lead:** Decides the scrope of the project. Product leads are in charge of ensuring the final product’s success and communicating with stakeholders. Your product lead will define the project’s core goals and deliverables, so you can focus on creating innovative design solutions. At some companies, product leads are known as product managers.
  - **UX Researcher:** Tries to understand user trust
  - **Interaction Designer**: Figures out the flow for ordering
  - **Visual Designer:** Thinks about how to make it easy for users to find allergen-free foods in the product using wireframes and prototypes
  - **Engineers:** Brings wireframes and prototypes to life. They help UX teams figure out if designs are feasible from a technical standpoint.
  - **Program Manager:** Ensures clear and timely communication across the team. Project managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines, among other things. Think of your team’s project manager as your go-to source of support when facing any setbacks or issues with your work.
