# Babel

When a new JavaScript feature is proposed and gains support, the community often wants to use it before itâ€™s supported by all browsers. The only way to be sure that your code will work is to convert it to more widely compatible code before running it in the browser. This process is called *compiling*. One of the most popular tools for JavaScript compilation is [Babel](http://www.babeljs.io/).



The [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl) will let you compare your code to compiled code.
