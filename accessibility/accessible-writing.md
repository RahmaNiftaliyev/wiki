# Accessible Writing

- Use simple words
- Be concise with calls to action
- Keep sentences short (Tweets short and full of information)
- Do not use style of font as the only indicator. Screen readers do not recognize font formatting such as strikethroughs, bold, color, italics, and underline. Use other types of indicators.
