# Layout Best Practices

- Title should be unique
- Hierarchy of page should reflect content
- Headers used for most important things on page
- Paragraphs contain text in sentence form
- Links should reflect where the user is going to go next. Should have enough contrast. Use action words as links and put periods for abbreviations (e.g., F.B.I).
- Images used as icons or bullets should be in the link.
- Use `div` and `span` for layout only. They're semantically meaningless. Never use these for buttons.
- Use one H1 per page and have it match the page title
- Do not skip heading levels when increasing, however you can skip when decreasing (h1, h2, h3, h2, h3, h4, h2, h3, h4)
- Taken out of context, the headings should represent the page content.
- If two buttons need to be placed side by side, consider using one CTA button and one ghost button.
- Add a "Skip to content" button as one of the first things a keyboard user encounters when coming to a site
