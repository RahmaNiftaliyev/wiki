# Designing for Accessibilty

**Accessibility**: Easily used or accessed by people with disabilities: adapted for use by people with disabilities.

People with visual disabilities often rely on screen readers, braille displays, zoom functions, or high contrast colors to get value from what's displayed on screen.

People with auditory disabilities often rely on captions or transcripts for video content.

People with motor disabilities often require speech-to-text software or keyboard-only interactions.

People with speech disabilities require a nonvocal means of interaction.

People with cognitive disabilities often require thoughtful and organized layouts with clear direction.



"Tech culture--from platforms to procurement to education--must shift away from focusing on accessibility when a person with a disability presents a need, and shift towrad treating accessibility as a consistently required part of every product."



According to the WHO, disability is a mismatched interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live.

Think about who you are excluding.



"Design is much more likely to be the source of exclusion than inclusion. When we design for other people, our own biases and preferences often lead the way. When we create a solution that was, ourelves, can see, touch, understand, or hear, it tends to work well for people with similar circumstances or preferences to us. It also ends up exclusing many more people."



WHO: "Disability is the mismatched interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live." - aka, the social definition of disability.



Accessibility often ends up benefitting all of us and allows for ease of use with our products. Including:

- People not fluent in English
- People who are unable to use a keyboard or mouse
- People with temporary disabilities
- Older people
- New users

### Disabilities to Pay Attention To

**Visual**: Blindness, low vision, color blindness

**Hearing**: Deaf and hard of hearing

**Motor**: Inability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited motor control

**Cognitive**: Learning disabilities, distractability, inability to focus on large amounts of information



### Situational Disabilities

- Using a device with a small screen
- Abilities changing due to getting older
- Temporary disabilites like a broken arm or lost glasses
- Situational limitations like bright sunlight, or being in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
- Using Internet that is limited or expensive



### Social vs Medical Models of Disability

The social model of disability says that disability is caused by the way society is organized. Society needs remove barriers that restrict life choices.

The medical model of disability says that people are disabled by their impairments or differences. The people need to be fixed.



### Types of Color Blindness

1 in 200 women are color blind. 1 in 12 men are color blind. - "The Secret Lives of Color" by Kassia St. Clair

**Red/Green**

- **Protanomaly**: Red cone photopigment is abnormal. Red/orange/yellow appear greener and not as bright. An X-linked disorder that affects 1% of males.
- **Protanopia**: No working red cone cells. Red appears black. Orange/yellow/green can appear yellow. An X-linked disorder that affects 1% of males.
- **Deuteranomaly**: Green cone photopigment is abnormal. Yellow and green appear redder. Violet and blue look the same. Very mild condition and the most common form. An X-linked disorder that affects 1% of males.
- **Deuteranopia**: No working green cone cells. Reds are brownish-yellow and greens are beige. An X-linked disorder that affects 1% of males.

**Blue/Yellow**

- **Tritanomaly**: Functionally limited blue cone cells. Blue appears greener. Hard to tell yellow and red from pink. Extremeley rare. An autosomal dominant disorder affecting males and females equally.
- **Tritanopia**: Lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green. Yellow appears violet or light-gray. Extremeley rare. An autosomal dominant disorder affecting males and females equally.

**Complete**

- **Cone monochromacy**: Two of three cone cell photopigments don't work. The is red cone monochromacy, green cone monochromacy, and blue cone monochromacy. Not possible to compare colors. The blue variety can also develop nystagmus. An autosomal recessive disorder.
- **Rod monochromacy or achromatopsia**: Very rare and the most severe form of color blindess. Present at birth. No cone cells have functional photopigments. The world appears in black, white, and gray. These people tend to be photophobic and may also experience nystagmuc. An autosomal recessive disorder.



**Tip:** Design in grayscale! It keeps you from adding meaning to color. In input field, make the invalid field error text stand out. Don't just relay on a red color to catch attention.

## Creating a Culture of Inclusivity/Accessibility

> Accessibility must be part of every aspect of business, part of the minimally viable product, a core part of how we approach the launch and growth of our platforms. 
>
> -David Peter

It takes a village. Having leadership buy-in is essential. Plant seeds with recommendations that improve accessibility. 



### Incorporating Accessibility into Design Systems

- Ensure the team has an understanding of accessibility in relation to your product
- Include accessibility into user stories, wireframes, and requirements
- Make it clear that each team is responsible for accessibility and inform them of what their responsibilities are
- Document navigation clearly
- Guidance of use of colors, forms, and focus of navigation
- Maintain documentation for reference when new members come noto a team



### Implementing Accessibility

- Establish responsibilites
- Conduct an initial audit
- Develop an organization policy
- Select software for evaluating and repairing web accessibility
- Provide training
- Promote accessibility throughout the organization
- Monitor accessibility 



### The Benefits of Accessibility

**Avoiding Discrimination and Legal Complaints**

- The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that people with disabilities can enjoy equal access to public services and "places of public accommodation" such as restaurants, movie theaters, and schools. The Department of Justics has concluded that the lack of accessibility for web sites may be a violation of the ADA.
- In 2018, there was 2,258 web accessibility lawsuits filed in the U.S. 
- Businesses can follow the WCAG and get a Letter of Reasonable Accessibility that testifies that their website has been audited and has reasonable accomodations for people with disabilities.

**Reaching a Wider Audience**

- The CDC estimates that one in four U.S. adults live a disability
- Accessibile design is beneficial to all users--not just those with disabilities 
- People with disabilities have an annual disposable income of $996 billion

**Building Positive PR**

- Accenture Strategy: 62% of consumers prefer to make purchases from a brand that is willing to take a stand on issues that matter. 47% are willing to walk away if they are disappointed in a company's words or actions. 17% will not return.
- Add an accessibility statement which states your commitment to web accessibility and the steps you have taken to comply with WCAG.

**Improves SEO**

- The goals of accessibility and SEO are aligned. 
- Also improves bounce rate (% of visitors that leave after only one page visit)

**Increasing Usability**

- In order to fulfill keyboard navigation, you must write well-organized navigation hierarchies. More users will be able to locate what they need.
- Alt text helps with bad internet connections
- Glossaries are helpful to people with cognitive disabilities and users who speak English as a second language.

**Writing Higher-Quality Code**

- Accessible websites tend to have cleaner code. a11y testing can often find usability bugs.



**Top 3 Reasons**

1. Increase your audience and customer base
2. May provide significant financial benefits
3. The better thing to do morally and legally
