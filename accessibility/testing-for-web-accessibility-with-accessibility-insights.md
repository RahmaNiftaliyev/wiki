## P.O.U.R.

WCAG concepts can be boiled down to these concepts: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. 

- **Perceivable:** Users are able to perceive the content through their senses via the browser or other assistive technology.
- **Operable:**  Users can interact with all controls and interactive elements using either the mouse, keyboard, or an assistive device.
- **Understandable:** Content is clear and limits confusion and ambiguity.
- **Robust:** A wide range of technologies and devices can access the content.

This is separate from understanding. This is literally just getting the information.
