# Assistive Technologies

Assistive Technology (AT) is a general terms that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities.

Promotes greater independence.

Adaptive technology is similar, but would seldom be used by nondisabled persons.

Ambulatory aids are assistive devices for mobility/ambulation.

  - Even the packaging was made accessible  - "if they can't get it out of the box, we've sort of fallen on our face with this whole process"
  - An example of designing *with* a population, instead of for one



### Screen Readers

A screen reader is a software program that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display.

- A combination of keys on the computer keyboard or braille display can instruct the speech synthesizer on what to say and to speak automatically when changes occur on the computer screen.
- A command can instruct the synthesizer to read or spell a word, read a line or full screen of text, find a strnig of text on the screen, announce the location of the computer's cursor or focused item, and so on.
- It can allow users to locate text displayed in a certain color, read predesignated parts of the screen on demand, read highlighted text, and identify the active choice on a menu.



**Software**

- JAWS (Job Access With Speech) - the most popular screen reader
- NVDA
- VoiceOver



**User Flow of a Screen Reader**

1. Screen reader identifies text or graphics
2. Screen reader navigates the page
3. Screen readers read text or graphics
4. Keyboard or Voice is used to navigate the web page
5. Text or graphics are read back to the user as speech or braille

### Voice Recognition

Voice recognition can be used for dictating tet in a form field, as well as for navigating and activating links, buttons, and other controls. Some allow complete control over computer interaction, including scrolling, copying/pasting, activate menus, etc..

Useful for:

- People with physical disabilities who cannot use the keyboard or mouse
- People with chronic conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries (RSI), who need to limit or avoid using the keyboard or mouse.
- People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need to use voice rather than to type.
- People with temporary limitations, such as a broken arm.
- People who are multitasking

Labels and identifiers for controls in the source code need to match their visual presentation, so it is clear which voice command will activate a control.
