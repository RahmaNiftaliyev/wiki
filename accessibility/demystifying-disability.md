# Demystifying Disability by Emily Ladau



## So, What is Disability Anyway?

- More than one billion people in the world are disabled.

- "Disability is not a brave struggle or courage in the face of adversity. Disability is an art. It's an ingenious way to live." - Neil Marcus

- Americans with Disabilites Act defines disability as:

  - A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or such individual;
  - A record of such an impairment; or
  - Being regarded as having such an impairment 

- Emily's definition: Disability: a stage of being; a natural part of the human experience.

- Stop using the word handicapped. It's outdated and has fallen out of favor. Use "disability" or "accessible" or "disabled person" or "person with a disability"

- People with disabilites will use either person-first language or identity-first language. You can be a person with a disability or a disabled person. A disability can be very much a part of who people are. e.g. "a person who is bisexual" vs "a bisexual person." Default to PFL unless you are informed otherwise.

- Don't ever refer to someone by their mobility equipment, e.g. "the hearing-aid lady", "the guy who uses a cane", "wheelchair person"

- Don't ever say "confined to a wheelchair" or "wheelchair-bound" These devices are enabling, not confining.

- Just say "disabled". No need to say "physically or mentally challenged" or "special needs" or "disAbled" or "differently abled"

- Don't say "high-functioning" or "low-functioning"

- Other words to watch out for: insane, lame, moron, crazy, idiot, imbecile, slow, stupid, crutch (use "leaning on that"), paralyzed (use "frozen"), deaf (use "isn't noticing"), blind (use "oblivious")

  - These are words that were historically used to refer to people with disabilities
  - These perpetuate disability as a bad thing

- Don't say you're OCD. Or that someone is acting bipolar.

- Don't say retarded, midget, cripple, gimp, spaz

- Say "able-bodied", "does not have a disability", "neurotypical", or "nondisabled" instead of "normal" or "regular"

  

## Understanding Disability as Part of a Whole Person

### Types of Disabilities

Note: some things don't fit into neat categories.

- **Chronic illnesses** can have an ongoing effect on varying aspects of a person's physical and mental health.
- **Communication disorders** affect how a person conveys or comprehends information.
- **Developmental disabilities** can affect the trajectory of a person's physical or congnitive growth.
- **Hearing disabilities** partially or completely affect a person's ability to hear.
- **Intellectual disabilities** can affect a person's communication, cognition, and personal and interpersonal activities.
- **Learning disabilities** affect the ways a person can learn, process, and understand different subject areas.
- **Mental health disabilities** can affect a person's thoughts, moods, and behavior.
- **Neurological disorders** can affect different parts of a person's nervous system, which can in turn affect them in many ways, including physically, cognitively, and emotionally.
- **Physical disabilities** can affect a person's movement, dexterity, or stamina.
- **Vision disabilities** partially or completely affect a person's ability to see.

There are also **temporary disabilities** and **acquired disabilities**.

Nondisabled people could be referred to as **temporarily able-bodied**.



### Models to Understand Disability

Both have their merits:

- **Medical Model**: aka "individual model", focuses on diability as a person-based issue. Disability as a diagnosis or impairment that has an effect on an idividual. Disability as a problem needing to be fixed/cured. A medical problem causes a certain condition. Ignores the fact that the effects of disability aren't limited to just a person's body.

- **Social Model:** people are disabled not by medical conditions but by environments, attitudes, and systems that create barriers. 

  

## An (Incomplete) Overview of Disability History

Lots of famous people were disabled, it's just never talked about. e.g. Harriet Tubman, Frida Kahlo, Franklin Roosevelt

- 1900s

  - Disability seen as a flaw in humanity. Laws existed to sterilize. 

- 1930s

  - FDR elected--the only U.S. president to have had a physical disability. He tried his best to hide the disability, fearing it would detract from his authority. 
  - Great Depression made it hard to find work. Work was impossible to find for the disabled. In 1935, a group of disabled people (the League of the Physically Handicapped) protested the discrimination they encounted from the Works Progress Administration and other agencies.
  - Social Security Act of 1935 included support for crippled children and for vocational rehabilitation 
  - Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 included a provision that allowed employers to pay workers with disabilities significantly below minimum wage, so they can get jobs to begin with. The law is still in place today.

- 1940s

  - Disabled Veterans Rehabilitation Act of 1943 helped wounded veterans find work.
  - 1945 brought the start of "National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week" (later changed to "National Disability Employment Awareness Month")
  - The National Federation of the Blind formed. It's the largest advocacy group for blind people. 
  - Paralyzed Veterans of America formed after WWII
  - National Mental Health Act of 1946 was partially a result of "combat fatigue" experienced by soldiers. This is when we started to move away from placing people with mental illness into institutions for treatment.

- 1950s

  - Eisenhower signed amendments that ensured previously employed people who were unable to work due to disability won't be at risk of losing their Social Security benefits. 
  - In 1956 the Social Security Act estability Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) - a monthly cash benefit to people that are unable to work for a year or more due to a disability. The larger goal has always been to get people to return to work, though.

- 1960s

  - In 1963, Kennedy sign the Mental Retardation and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act. It created alternatives to asylums.
  - Kennedy's sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, launched the Special Olympics in 1968--first one held in Chicago
  - The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 was the first law that mandated the accessibility of buildings. This was for buildings built with federal funds.

- 1970s

  - Lawsuit against the New York City Board of Education where Judith Heumann won claiming discrimination after the board denied her a teaching license due to not passing a physical exam.
  - In 1972, Geraldo Rivera exposed the Willowbrook State School in New York, which warehoused disabled people and made them live in filth. It didn't close until 1987.
  - The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 formed the U.S. Access Board which enforced with Architectural Barriers Act. Discrimination on the basis of disability is now banned for federal employers. This includes Section 504, though there were no guidelines for interpretation.
  - In 1974, the "Ugly Laws" in Chicago were repealed. These laws existed to remove beggars with visible physical differences from the streets. 
  - The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 established the right for all disabled children to access public education. This was renamed to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1997. The law has yet to be fully funded by the government. 
  - Sit-ins started to try to get Section 504 enforced. The sit-in at the HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) building in San Francisco remains as the longest non-violent occupation of a federal building in the United States (30 days). Known as athe 503 Sit-In. The Black Panthers aided. Soon after the regulations for interpretation were signed.
  - Another protest by the "Gang of 19" blocked an intersection for wheelchair-accessible buses.

- 1980s

  - The Gang of 19 turns into the American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT), one of the most notable disability activist groups in the nation.
  - In 1984, the Paralympic Games came to the United States.
  - The Voting Accessibility for the Eldery and Handicapped Act of 1984 (polling places need to be accessible)
  - The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (commercial airlines can't discriminate against disabled people)
  - A d/Deaf school protest, Deaf President Now (DPN), brought an explosion of awareness on accessibility and American Sign Language

- 1990s

  - The Americans with Disabilites Act (ADA) was signed, but not without hiccups. There was a protest against delay called the "Capitol Crawl." It was eventually sign into law by George H. W. Bush in 1990.
  - In 1999, the Supreme Court decided that the ADA prohibits the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled people.

- 2000s

  - 2019: Ali Stroker is the first wheelchair user to win a Tony Award

    

	## Abelism and Accessibility

"Abelism is attitudes, actions, and circumstances that devalue people because they are disabled or perceived as having a disability."

- Abelism is woven into the fabric of society. It manifests in form of broad, systemic discrimination to individual interactions.

- System Abelism: Less than 25% of NYC subway stations have elevators. Many people operate on the assumption that disabled people don't have full lives that might require public transportation.
- There are still laws on the books that explicitly discriminate against disabled people. The Fair Labor Standards Act lets disabled people be paid less than minimum wage. People with disabilities aren't inherently disadvataged, rather, they're put at a disadvantage.
- There are workplaces knows as "sheltered workshops" which hires disabled people exclusively for very little money. This includes companies like Goodwill.
- 2016: A blind man sues Domino's Pizza arguing its mobile app and website violated that Americans with Disabilities Act. Domino's pushed this to the Supreme Court in 2019, and was rejected. The lower court ruled that Domino's must make its app and website accessible.
- Watch out for social justice movements--even they may exclude disabilities (e.g. TIME'S UP mission statement did not mention the disabled)
- In two-thirds of the United States there are statutes in place that allows courts to deem a parent unfit on the basis on their disability
- Rideshare drivers regularly refuse ride to people that use mobility equipment and/or have a service animal
- Austic kids are largely expected to be "normal" and are subjected to potentially harmful behavioral therapy to reinforce/quell certain behaviors
- Hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are institutionalized
- Nondisabled people often assume people with disabilities want to be "fixed" or "cured"
- In 2015, more than 800 disabled people were murdered by their caregivers. Media often portrays the killers are relieving themselves of a burden.



An accessible product or service is a product or service that can be **fully** used or experienced by disabled people.

Accessibility is when disabled people can occupy and move about a space freely.

Examples of accomodations:

- Quiet rooms with dim lights to decompress from sensory overload at events
- Flexible hours, so people can work on schedules that work for their bodies
- Sending slide decks in advance so people have time to process the information
- Providing a combination of live camptioning and sign language interpreters. Helps people with hearing and processing disabilities at live events.
- Designated seating areas for people with mobility disabilities. 
- Offering large-prit or Braille materials for people with vision disabilities

Think of inaccessibility as not having the right password for something like a bathroom. You feel shut out and excluded.

Accessibility is *not* about special treatment or privileges. There are occasional "perks" but more often than not, disabled people need to use back doors in alleys to get in a building. And they are constantly being turned away from places.

"People with disabilities don't really visit this location/shop here/apply for jobs with us/attend this event, so what's the point of accessibility anyway?" is SO inaccurate. A. They can't because you're not accessibile and B. There are many disabilities and some are non-apparent. What people really say when they say this is "Disabled people are unwelcome here."

The "curb-cut effect": eliminating inaccessibility benefits everyone

## Disability Etiquette 101

- Don't comment on assistive devices (e.g. "You got a license for that thing?")
- Don't ask personal questiong (e.g. "Can you walk? Have sex? What is your life expectancy?")
- Don't suggest what you think are helpful solutions (e.g. "Have you tried yoga?"). Disabled people are experts on their bodies. If you must, say "Can I share something that worked for me?"
- You can ask questions that don't invade privacy, such as details about a power-assisted wheelchair. Preface with a "May I ask you a question about..."
- It's better to ask than avoid talking about accessibility needs. You can ask "Hey, do you/does anyone have any accessibility needs to participate? Let me know how I can support you!" or "I want to make sure what I'm planning works for you. Is there anything I can do or any accomodations you might need to make this accessible so you can fully participate?"
- Consider an assistive device an extension of someone's body, even if they are not currently using it. Don't touch it. Don't give unsolicted help to people. Unwelcome touch is especially a big issue with service animal handlers. Petting breaks concentration.
- Communicate with disabled people as you would with anyone else.
- When communicating with blind people, say your name before speaking.
- To get a d/Deaf person's attention, wave. Don't tap them on their shoulder or flicker the lights. If they have an interpreter, look at the person you're talking to instead of the interpreter. No need to say "Can you please tell them.."
- For people who stutter or speak slowly, don't play guessing games or attempt to rush them.
- Take a few steps back from a shorter person, so they don't have to crank their necks. Shorter people also often don't mind if you bend down or kneel, but it's best to ask so you don't come off as patronizing. 
- For people with cognitive disabilities, there's no need to speak slower, louder, or with a different tone, unless you're asked to. Just try to use clear, consise words and explain any jargon.
- Don't infantilize. 
- Don't make assumptions that people have a certain disability. 
- Don't try to help without asking first.
- Don't stare, but don't make a point of looking away.
- Don't pray over disabled people.
- Don't assume someone's disability status. Many disabilities are invisible. Also, don't go out your way to pretend that an evident disability is not there,
- Don't use accessible amenities if you don't need them.
- Don't pretend you "get it." Even if you had to use a wheelchair once, you don't actually understand a lifetime of barriers. 
- With kids, tell them it's okay to be curious but it's not okay to say things that could be mean (e.g. "Why does he walk funny?")



## Disability in the Media

- 15% of the world's population is disabled however only 3.1% of TV series regulars are disabled (GLAAD 2019-2020 "Where We Are on TV" report)
- Lots of media makers rely heavily on stereotypes and stigmas that reflect and perpetuate society's negative views of disability. 
- Media tropes to look out for:
  - **Inspiration Porn:** A story about a person with a disability taht overcomes their disability (e.g. can walk again). Creates pity towards people with disabilities, which is a patronizing way to think about people with disabilities. 
    - **Overcoming Adversity:** "Your excuse is invalid" - Disability is not an internal barrier that can be overcome only if you try hard enough. Disability is not a personal failing.
    - **Life's Moments:** e.g. A paralyzed person being held for a first dance. Disability does not hold people back from a full life.
    - **Great Expectations:** e.g. A disabled person overcomes odds. Disabled people are not deserving of pity. Disabled people are also complex and should not be labeled as just disabled. Disabled people don't need to prove anything to anyone. Disabled people are both capable and fallible. 
    - **Not Your Good Deed:** e.g. Teens crown disabled girl homecoming queen. Simply being nice to a disabled person shouldn't be considered newsworthy. 
  - **Pity Porn:** the idea of disability as tragic
    - **The "Tragedy" of Physical Disability:** e.g. The annual Labor Day telethon for Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) hosted by Jerry Lewis which features disabled children as pathetic charity cases. e.g. Showing sorrow if a child is born with a disability. e.g. The stereotyping of Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol. e.g. Jojo's Moyes's Me Before You points Will as becoming convinced that life will be nothing but misery after becoming disabled. Instead of continuing to live, Will chooses assisted suicide. It spreads the message that disability is a fate worse than death. 
    - **Stigmatizing Mental Illness:** e.g. tabloids about celebrity mental breakdowns. e.g. Assuming people that commit mass violence are mentally ill--studies have debunked this. 
    - **Freaks and Other "Abnormalities"**: e.g. dramatizing stories of people with complex diagnosis--the weirder the better. These rely on society's morbid fascination with minds and bodies that are "different". These people are often mocked. 
    - **Sex and Relationships:** Many people assume that disabled people aren't able to/don't want to/shouldn't find love and have sex when in reality they fall on the same spectrum of sexual preferences and identities as nondisabled people.



## Conclusion: Calling All Allies and Accomplices

- The first step to being an ally is unlearning this misconception that disabled people are helpless and in need and recognizing that disabled people aren't in need of saving. You are not there to help disabled people.
- To be an accomplice is to work side by side with people who are marginalized, to confront the system and contribute to shifting it accordingly.
- Disabled people need to be included in any conversation about them. Policymakers shouldn't consult nondiabled experts. Doctors and teachers need to talk to disabled people instead of their caregivers. 
- A game of pretend won't help you understand a person's entire life experience and identity (e.g. wearing earplugs for a day). Instead, learn about disability through disabled people.
